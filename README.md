# Machine Learning Coursework - BGSE
Alongside theoretical coursework, there were also  practical problems to solve through implementations and simulations. There are four simulation tasks:
1. Random Projections into two dimensions
2. Nearest neighbour
3. Perceptron algorithm
4. Large Margin Classiefiers
