# Machine Learning Coursework - BGSE
This repository includes some implementations done for the master's course in machine learning taught by Gabor Lugosi (http://www.econ.upf.edu/~lugosi/).

Alongside mostly theoretical problem sets, there were also practical problems to solve through implementations and simulations. These are four example simulation tasks:
1. Random Projections into two dimensions
2. K-Nearest-Neighbours
3. Perceptron algorithm
4. Large Margin Classifiers
